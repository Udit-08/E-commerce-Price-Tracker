# E-commerce-Price-Tracker
This script will scrape book details (Title, Price, Stock status, and Rating) from Books to Scrape
 and save the data into a nicely formatted Excel file (products_report.xlsx). It uses Selenium to load the webpage like a real user, ensuring that all dynamic content is captured reliably.

The Excel file includes:

Bold headers for easy reading

Prices formatted as currency

“Out of stock” products highlighted in red

Columns automatically sized for readability
